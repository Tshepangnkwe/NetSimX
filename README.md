# NetSimX

**Network Topology Design and Simulation Project (CMPG325 - 2025)**  
*Developed using Cisco Packet Tracer*

## Overview

NetSimX demonstrates the design, configuration, and simulation of multiple network topologies, including an integrated hybrid design featuring IPv4/IPv6 dual-stack, VLAN segmentation, and essential network services (HTTP, DNS, DHCP).

## Topologies Implemented

- **Bus**
- **Star**  
- **Ring**
- **Mesh**
- **Extended Star**
- **Hybrid** (combining elements of the above)

Each topology has been tested for device communication, routing accuracy, and proper IP addressing.

## Configurations and Services

- **VLANs**: Segmentation by department/function
- **Routing**: Inter-VLAN and IPv6 routing  
- **Services**: HTTP, DNS, DHCP
- **Security**: Basic ACLs and password protection

Configuration files are available in the `/configs` directory.

## Documentation

Detailed design notes, configuration explanations, and test results can be found in the `/docs` directory.

## Video Demonstrations

Two short videos showcase:
- Network design and simulation  
- Feature configuration and functionality

Available in `/videos`.

## Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer 8.x
- Git & GitHub
- Markdown Documentation
