# NetSimX Hybrid Network Design Notes

## Project Overview
NetSimX is a comprehensive network simulation project that demonstrates five core network topologies and culminates in a hybrid design that incorporates multiple topology types to create a realistic enterprise network infrastructure.

## Core Topologies Implemented

### 1. Bus Topology

- **Disadvantages**: Single point of failure, collision domains, limited scalability
- **Use Cases**: Small networks, temporary setups, legacy systems
- **Implementation Notes**: 
  - Uses coaxial cable backbone
  - Terminators required at both ends
  - Maximum segment length limitations apply

### 2. Star Topology

- **Advantages**: Easy troubleshooting, centralized management, no collisions
- **Disadvantages**: Central point of failure, hub/switch bottleneck
- **Use Cases**: Most common in modern LANs, office networks
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Central switch provides dedicated bandwidth per port
  - Easy to add/remove devices
  - Supports full-duplex communication

### 3. Ring Topology
- **Description**: Devices connected in circular fashion with token passing
- **Advantages**: Deterministic access, equal access for all devices
- **Disadvantages**: Single break affects entire network, token management complexity
- **Use Cases**: Industrial networks, fiber optic networks, legacy Token Ring
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Token passing protocol ensures fair access
  - Can implement dual-ring for redundancy
  - Automatic bypass for failed nodes

### 4. Mesh Topology
- **Description**: Multiple interconnections between devices providing redundancy
- **Advantages**: High reliability, multiple paths, fault tolerance
- **Disadvantages**: Complex configuration, high cost, many connections required
- **Use Cases**: Core network infrastructure, mission-critical systems
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Full mesh: n(n-1)/2 connections required
  - Partial mesh: Strategic redundant connections
  - Supports load balancing and automatic failover

### 5. Extended Star Topology
- **Description**: Multiple star networks connected through backbone switches
- **Advantages**: Hierarchical design, scalable, localized traffic containment
- **Disadvantages**: More complex than simple star, potential bottlenecks
- **Use Cases**: Large enterprise networks, campus networks, multi-building sites
- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Three-tier architecture: Core, Distribution, Access
  - VLANs for logical segmentation
  - Inter-VLAN routing at distribution layer
