# Implementation Directory

This directory contains the actual working implementations, testing files, and project artifacts created during the NetSimX development process.

## Directory Structure

### `/packet_tracer_files/`
- Working Cisco Packet Tracer (.pkt) files during development
- Backup versions of topology files
- Experimental and test configurations

### `/device_backups/`
- Router and switch configuration backups (.txt files)
- Running-config exports from Packet Tracer devices
- Startup-config files for each network device

### `/testing_logs/`
- Connectivity test results
- Performance testing data
- Ping, traceroute, and network diagnostic outputs
- Validation test scripts and results

### `/network_diagrams/`
- Network topology diagrams (.png, .jpg, .pdf)
- Physical and logical network layouts
- VLAN diagrams and IP addressing schemes
- Created using Visio, Draw.io, or Packet Tracer exports

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Development Workflow**
   - Create and test topologies in `/packet_tracer_files/`
   - Export device configurations to `/device_backups/`
   - Document all tests in `/testing_logs/`
   - Generate diagrams for `/network_diagrams/`

2. **File Naming Conventions**
   - Use descriptive names with dates: `bus_topology_v1_2025-10-13.pkt`
   - Device configs: `core_router_config_2025-10-13.txt`
   - Test logs: `connectivity_test_results_2025-10-13.txt`

3. **Version Control**
   - Keep working files here during development
   - Move finalized versions to `/topologies/` and `/configs/`
   - Document major changes and iterations

## Development Notes

This implementation directory serves as the working space for:
- Iterative topology development
- Configuration testing and refinement
- Performance validation and optimization
- Documentation of the development process

Files in this directory represent work-in-progress and may contain experimental configurations that are not yet ready for the main project deliverables.
